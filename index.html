    <h3>Linux Shell Scripting & System Audits</h3>

    <p>
      A collection of Linux shell scripts developed over 20+ days while learning
  Linux fundamentals. The repository focuses on system monitoring, file
  permission checks, and basic security auditing concepts.

    <!--APPROACH SECTION -->
    <h2 id="approach">How I Think</h2>
    <p>
  Learning is approached through hands-on practice rather than
  memorizing concepts. New topics are explored by starting with
  fundamentals and writing small programs or scripts to understand
  how things work in real scenarios.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  Problem-solving is done step by step by breaking tasks into
  smaller parts and improving solutions gradually. Errors are
  treated as learning opportunities, and debugging plays an
  important role in strengthening understanding.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  Preference is given to understanding internal working and core
  concepts instead of depending only on tools or shortcuts. This
  approach helps build a strong foundation across programming,
  Linux, and system-related topics.
    </p>

    <!--ABOUT ME SECTION -->
    <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
    
    <p>
  Computer Science student focused on building strong fundamentals
  in programming, systems, and software development through
  consistent hands-on practice and real-world oriented projects.
  I prioritize understanding core concepts deeply rather than
  relying on surface-level implementation.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  Comfortable working with Python, C programming, DBMS, and Linux,
  with experience applying these skills in practical scenarios.
  Linux is a core area of focus, involving extensive work with
  shell scripting, system exploration, file systems, permissions,
  and security-focused tasks, all documented and maintained
  through public GitHub repositories.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  Currently advancing deeper into Linux internals, including
  service and process management, system monitoring, automation,
  and structured capstone-style projects. This learning is
  accompanied by continuous experimentation, debugging, and
  improvement, with regular updates pushed to GitHub to reflect
  growth and refinement.
    </p>
    
    <p>
  Strongly motivated to contribute to open-source platforms and
  engage with real-world technical challenges. I believe in
  build-first, learning by writing code, breaking
  systems, fixing issues, and refining solutions — with a
  long-term goal of developing strong system-level thinking,
  contributing to impactful projects, and mentoring others as
  I grow professionally.
    </p>

    <h2 id="contact">Contact</h2>
    <p>
      I would appreciate the opportunity to connect with mentors,
  peers, and professionals for learning and technical discussions.
